# sudoku

A repository to solve 9x9 sudoku puzzles with linear programming (LP).

An example classes and abstraction to create extendable, modular code.

A research project of two different datastructures to implement LP variable storage.

A general example of how computer programming is magic.

The main 4 files are:
- tester.py : to boot up a user's command line interface
- Solver.py : defines three classes, a SolverParent class and two child classes that use different datastructures
- SolverInterface.py : contains the method names of all classes in Solver.py
- Board.py : defines the board class, to allow a developer to change board implementation without change how the user interacts with the command line interface.
